# Project9-ReactNative-FireQuestions

Fire Question is a question-based social media platform that helps people connecting together on a platform so they can share knowledge and experiences over different topics they need help with whether it was out of curiosity or to solve a problem someone is facing with their daily life problems through asking other people in a comfortable way as all the questions and answers will be anonymous, the questions will be divided into categories. The user can sign up into an account to make a profile and start using the app.

The app works on a points system whenever the user asks a question one point will be taken and points will be added when the user submit good answers to other users questions, this points is to keep our platform free and make sure whoever uses our application is posting questions and also answering someone else's question.

The right answers to each question will be determined through other users' votes so the question asker could know which are the answers to take under consideration, this can help people to seek the help they need whenever they want and without a cost.
